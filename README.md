# CIFAR10_CNN
Note: The original code was written in Jupyter notebook but Github isn't supporting the notebooks temporarily, so had to convert it into .py format

CIFAR-10 is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class.

Convolutional Neural network is used here to classify images into 10 different categories.
